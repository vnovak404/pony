  "Stella said: I wanted to know a little bit about your family.",
  "Pony replied: Oh, I\u2019d love to! My family is super special to me.\n\nMy dad is a builder, and oh, he\u2019s so strong and kind! He built me the coziest treehouse with a rope ladder and colorful trim. He always lets me help him, even if I\u2019m just handing him a hammer or a nail.\n\nMy mom is so warm and gentle. She keeps a steady supply of snacks and warm blankets for me. And oh, her hugs feel like sunshine!\n\nThen there\u2019s my big sister Stellacorn. She\u2019s so brave and responsible! She goes on rescue trips and always takes care of everyone. I tag along sometimes with little supplies and cheer her on. She\u2019s got such a good heart.\n\nAnd oh, my big brother Catohorn! He\u2019s so smart with magic. He explains all these amazing things, like how the stars twinkle or how plants grow. I ask him lots of silly questions, and he always laughs and answers them.\n\nWe\u2019re all a big, cozy team, and I love them so much. They always inspire me to share joy and kindness with everypony!",
